# ImageRoller
Grab a random image from a folder

This is a small WPF app that will pull a random image from a folder and allow you to copy it. It keeps track of the folders you've opened and allows for quick opening.

I'm not sure if anyone (other than me) has a use for this, but if you do, feel free to download it.
